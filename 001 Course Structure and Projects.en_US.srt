1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,893
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,893 --> 00:00:06,410
Hello, and welcome to the complete JavaScript course.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,220
I'm really, really happy to welcome you to this huge course

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,900
which will take you from knowing nothing about JavaScript

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,253
to an expert JavaScript developer.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,780
And learning JavaScript is a great choice,

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,460
not only because it's the most popular programming language

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,710
in the world,

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,710
but also because it basically powers the entire modern web.

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,110
And this course is, in my opinion,

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,890
the very best way of learning JavaScript that you will find.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,833
And so you have come to the right place.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,000
Now, before we start learning,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,760
let's take a couple of minutes to get a quick overview

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,990
of how the course is organized,

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,720
and the projects that we're gonna build together,

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,563
so that you know exactly what to expect.

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,760
So the course contains about 20 sections

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,540
with over 60 hours of video content.

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,450
And we're gonna kick off the course

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,860
in section two and three with the very basics

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,690
of the JavaScript language,

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,510
to give you a solid foundation for the rest of the course.

24
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,030
Then you will learn some general skills

25
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,240
that you will need as a developer,

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,090
like problem solving, fixing errors,

27
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,320
and setting up a development environment.

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,960
After that, we built our very first project

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,160
with the user interface.

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,320
So this section is about DOM manipulation.

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,840
And we will build not one but actually three beautiful,

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,200
but simple applications.

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,050
Then in section eight,

34
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,770
we will take a detailed look behind the scenes

35
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,310
of JavaScript to learn how the language actually works.

36
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,930
And this will give you valuable knowledge

37
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,820
that many other developers simply don't have.

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,240
Then in sections nine and 10,

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,060
we will keep working on our JavaScript fundamentals,

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,290
but now with a focus on more modern ES6 topics,

41
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,280
such as maps and destructuring,

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,280
and also strings, functions, closures, and more.

43
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,670
Then, throughout sections 11 and 12,

44
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,890
we will build our next beautiful project,

45
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,270
which will teach you all you need to know

46
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,983
about array methods, numbers, dates, and timers.

47
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,390
And after that, we jump right into our next project

48
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,240
which is gonna be this beautiful website full packed

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,320
with visual effects and components,

50
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,420
such as lazy image loading, a tapped component,

51
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,720
a slider, and so much more.

52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,960
In section 14, we finally reach the pretty advanced,

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,800
but also very important topic of object oriented programming

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,590
with constructor functions and ES6 classes.

55
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,260
Which will then in the next section,

56
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,780
allow us to build this stunning real world project.

57
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,750
And besides object oriented programming,

58
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,750
this project will also teach you how to incorporate a map,

59
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,860
and how to actually plan and structure a project,

60
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,800
which is also super important.

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,650
After that, you're gonna learn

62
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,380
all about asynchronous JavaScript,

63
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,350
which is used for things like loading data

64
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,220
from external web servers with Ajax.

65
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,880
Then in section 17 and 18,

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,980
we will learn how modern JavaScript applications

67
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,800
are actually built using cutting edge technologies

68
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,800
like NPM, Babel, Parcel and ES6 modules.

69
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,830
We then take these modern tools

70
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,300
and everything that we have learned up until this point,

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,100
to build this biggest and coolest project in the course.

72
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,710
And we then even finished this project by deploying it

73
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,493
to the internet using Netlify in Git in section 19.

74
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,840
So as you see,

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,170
I included everything you need to know about JavaScript

76
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,520
in this course.

77
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Along with a ton of real world projects and challenges.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,550
Now, your next step is to watch the next lecture

79
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,180
which is super important to set you up for success

80
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,530
in this course.

81
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,193
With instructions for many things like how to ask questions.

82
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,840
Now, if you already know the fundamentals of JavaScript,

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,040
then after the next lecture,

84
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,050
please move ahead to the section

85
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,880
called how to navigate this course.

86
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,350
Where you will then find your perfect learning path

87
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,540
to navigate this huge course.

88
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,800
But if you're new to JavaScript,

89
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,470
then of course, just move on to the next section.

90
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,360
All right, so I hope that you're gonna have a ton of fun

91
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,590
with this course

92
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,620
that you become a really advanced JavaScript developer,

93
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,740
and that you will take your web development career

94
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,030
to the next level.

95
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,846
And with that being said, let's finally get started.

96
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:22,513
(upbeat music)
